<h1 class="!mb-0">Intro to YYJ Tech Slack Channels</h2>

Slack is organized into "[channels](https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Lu39IFAmeE)" on the left-hand side bar. You can navigate between channels, join, leave and create as you like in this space - it's up to you. 

* Channels below with a link have active [channel stewardship](/channel-stewards) to help grow and support the channel
* Channels without a link have more varying participation, but you're still welcome to join
* Into something else more niche? Search in the channels to find others with the same interest, or start something of your own and let others know in [#-channel-discovery](https://yyjtech.slack.com/archives/CK5TF106L)

As mentioned in our Code of Conduct [spam section](https://github.com/yyjtech/code-of-conduct#spam), please keep discussion related to the YYJ (aka Victoria, BC) and nearby communities unless the channel specifically mentions otherwise.
